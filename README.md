# Automate The Boring Stuff...then make it less boring

### This assignment repositority is for you to write the code that accompanies [Automate The Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc)

**Directions:**
- As you read each chapter in ATBS, you have the option to 1) read the words 2) type and observe the examples or 3) some combination of the two. You will need to determine for yourself what works, and that may take some trial and error. Consider reading the Summary section at the bottom of each chapter first as a preview to prime your brain for what's coming.
- You will be required to type out all the examples with the heading **A Short Program:**, saving each as their own file within this repository.
- Once you have typed each program as written in ATBS, make at least three changes to that program, predict what changes you will see, and then observe those changes. Add a comment by each change noting what you changed and what results you observed. _These commented program files are what you will submit for homework_.
